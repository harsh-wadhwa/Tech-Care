## Inspiration

Every allopathic doctor in India caters to at least 1,511 people, much higher than the World Health Organization’s norm of one doctor for every 1,000 people. The shortage of trained nurses is even direr, with a nurse-to-population ratio of 1:670 against the WHO norm of 1:300.

So, it is obvious that whenever a patient visits the doctor it takes a long time to get consult with him, he has to stand in rows for a long time and when I saw these people who are unable to properly stand due to their illness, had to stand for a long to get:
(i) the  prescription slip
(ii) consultation with a doctor
(iii) Medicine ( have to stand in a long queue)

So on that day, I thought we are living in the digital world, so why not digitalize the health sector and save the time and efforts of both patients as well as doctors.

## What it does

Our product will help in transforming the entire healthcare system in India from as we know it, to a much more sophisticated digital system. It is in line with the Government Of India’s efforts of digitizing the Indian economy. Our product provides various services, the most notable being the unique Health ID system, that will help in storing all the medical history of a patient and make it easily available, anytime, and anywhere.

1. Complete medical history at a place.
2. Touch-free, paperless system.
3. Single database.
4. Unique patient id for every citizen.
5. Lesser risk of allergic reaction.
6. Easy to keep track of medical expenses.

## How we built it

we have built it using the python language and using firebase as our database to ensure its security.

## Challenges we ran into

1. Difficulty in physical communication due to covid pandemic.
2. Database security.
3. Database schema design.
4. Connect two interfaces with a single database.
5. User-friendly UI design.
6. User privacy.
